# In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
 is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
# what does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.
# what is npm?
As I mentioned earlier, Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.
# what version of node are you running on your machine?
Welcome to Node.js v12.21.0.
# what version of npm are you running on your machine?
 npm: '7.8.0',
# what command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
npm install -g jshint
# what is node used for?
Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

# How does pair programming work?
while there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
