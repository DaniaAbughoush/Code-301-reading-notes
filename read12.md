for transactions purpose, it is still not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications.

# Give a real world example.
MongoDB

# what  is a realational database?
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. 

# what  type of structure does a relational database work with?
logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.


# what  is a ‘schema’?
 database schema is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database. It describes both the organization of data and ...

# what  is a NoSQL database?
When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.

# Howo does it work?
One way of understanding the appeal of NoSQL databases from a design perspective is to look at how the data models of a SQL and a NoSQL database might look in an oversimplified example using address data.

The SQL Case. For an SQL database, setting up a database for addresses begins with the logical construction of the format and the expectation that the records to be stored are going to remain relatively unchanged. After analyzing the expected query patterns, an SQL database might optimize storage in two tables,

# what  is inside of a Mongo database?
A document is a representation of a single entity of data in the MongoDB database. A collection consists of one or more related objects. A major difference exists between MongoDB and SQL, in that documents are different from rows. Row data is flat, with one column for each value in the row.

# Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB is best suitable for hierarchical data storage, but RDBMS is not. MongoDB supports JSON query language along with SQL but RDBMS supports SQL query language only. ... MongoDB is almost 100 times faster than traditional database system like RDBMS, which is slower in comparison with the NoSQL databases

# what  is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
